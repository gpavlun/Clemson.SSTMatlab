% in order for this to graph from -1 to 17, you cannot represent all of the
% pulses at a length of time T where T is equal to 2. In order to correct
% this, I have doubled to length that the signal is generated to account
% for the necessary additional time.

% an email was sent out confirming my correction, thanks
